## CAPSTONE PROJECT : Online shop for video games

</h1>This project is about creating an online shop based on an online shop for electronics (https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX). It is a capstone project required at the end of each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections.
In this repository, I created an online shop for video games that is responsive to both Mobile & Ipad view and includes three breakpoints

- The first breakpoint is at 567px.
- The first breakpoint is at 768px.
- The second breakpoint is at 990px.

The webpage is built with business specifications ( See link above ) and using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap 4 framework. It contains two pages :

- Home page.
- Results page.</h1>
